# tec2vtk #

This program aims to create legacy VTK files from Tecplot files generated 
by simulation software. The program assumes that the Tecplot files contain 
a mesh data and corresponding nodal values. The program is still under 
development and may fails. Currently it supports line, quad, triangle, 
tetrahedron, hexahedron, and prism elements.
